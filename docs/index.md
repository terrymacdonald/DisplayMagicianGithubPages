## Welcome to the home of DisplayMagician

[DisplayMagician](https://displaymagician.littlebitbig.com) is an open source tool for automatically configuring your displays and sound for a game or application from a single Windows Shortcut. It works like this:

1. Change your display settings so they work with your favourite game
2. Start DisplayMagician and save your current display settings as a Display Profile.
3. Create a Game Shortcut within DisplayMagician that uses the new Display Profile.
4. Save the new Game Shortcut to your Desktop.

Now, when you click the Game Shortcut it will:

* Change your display settings to match the Display Profile you selected in the Game Shortcut
* Change your audio settings to match the audio settings you selected in the Game Shortcut
* Start up to 4 additional applications before your game starts... perfect for all that simracing software like SimHub
* Start the game (Supports Steam and Uplay game libraries, or directly running a game or application executable)


DisplayMagician will then wait for you to finish playing your game. When you have finished, and exit your game, DisplayMagician will then:
* Exit the additional applications it started earlier (or you can leave them running if you want).
* Revert the audio setting changes to how you had them set before (or you can keep the audio changes).
* Revert the Display Profile changes to how you had them set before (or you can keep the display setting changes).
